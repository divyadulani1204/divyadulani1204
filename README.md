## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I’m a driven and curious AI Engineer with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **Generative AI**, and **Process Automation**. My core strength lies in building intelligent, scalable solutions that blend the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with real-world applications.

With hands-on experience across data pipelines, model deployment, and RPA tools, I love solving complex problems through automation and AI-powered decision-making.
